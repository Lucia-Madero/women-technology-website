            <h4>
              I have always been a very curious person. My interest in
              technology started during my first career as a conference
              interpreter, when I had the oportunity to manipulate machine
              translation engines and computer-assisted, translation memory
              software.
            </h4>
            <div class="intro-second">
              <h4>
                At some point I decided that I wanted to become part of the IT
                industry, in which I have been working for the last 4 years as a
                technical project manager. It is never too late one may think,
                but I am persuaded that if I had had the opportunity to meet
                more female coders or technicians earlier in my career I would
                have overcome some mental fears and barriers long ago. For this
                reason, I have picked the topic 'Women in technology' for my
                website project !
