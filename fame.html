          <h1>Hedy Lamarr</h1>
          <h4>
            was an Austrian-born American actress, inventor, and film producer.
            She appeared in 30 films over a 28-year career in Europe and the
            United States, and co-invented with composer George Antheil an early
            version of frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication,
            originally intended for torpedo guidance.

          <h4>
            Although the US Navy did not adopt Lamarr and Antheil's invention
            until 1957, various spread-spectrum techniques are incorporated into
            Bluetooth technology and are similar to methods used in legacy
            versions of Wi-Fi. Recognition of the value of their work resulted
            in the pair being posthumously inducted into the National Inventors
            Hall of Fame in 2014.

          <h4>
            was born in 1913 and died in 1985 and was an American roman catholic
            religious sister. In 1958 she started at the National Science
            Foundation workshop in the computer science department at Dartmouth
            College which at the time was an all-male school. She teamed up with
            2 other scientists to develop the BASIC computer programming
            language.

            <h4>
              In 1965 Mary earned her PH. D in computer science from the
              University of Michigan. She went on to develop a computer science
              department in a catholic college for women called Clarke College.
              For 20 years she chaired the department where she was an advocate
              for women in computer science and supported working mothers by
              encouraging them to bring their babies to class with them. She is
              known as one of the famous women in technology for being the first
              woman to receive a PH. D in computer science and Clarke University
              (Clarke College) have established the Mary Keller Computer Science
              Scholarship in her honour.

            Annie was born in 1933 and died in 2011, she was born in Birmingham,
            Alabama and attended Xavier University where she majored in pharmacy
            for around 2 years. Shortly after finishing University, she met her
            husband and they moved to Cleveland. This is where Annie’s life
            changed for the better. As there was no pharmaceutical school
            nearby, she applied for a job at the National Advisory Committee for
            Aeronautics (NACA) and within 2 weeks had started working there.

            She was one of four African Americans who worked there and developed
            and implemented code which led to the development of the battery’s
            used in hybrid cars. She is well known for being one of the famous
            women in technology for encouraging women and people of her colour
            to study and enter STEM fields.
